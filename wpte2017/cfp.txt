                             CALL FOR PAPERS

                      Fourth International Workshop on
    Rewriting Techniques for Program Transformations and Evaluation

                                WPTE 2017

                        affiliated with FSCD 2017

                      8 September, 2017, Oxford, UK

========================================================================================

Aims and Scope
==============
The aim of WPTE is to bring together the researchers working on program transformations, 
evaluation, and operationally-based programming language semantics, using rewriting 
methods, in order to share the techniques and recent developments and to exchange ideas 
to encourage further activation of research in this area. 
The previous WPTE were held in Vienna 2014, in Warsaw 2015, and in Porto 2016.

Topics of interest in the scope of this workshop include:

* Correctness of program transformations, optimizations and translations.
* Program transformations for proving termination, confluence and other properties.
* Correctness of evaluation strategies.
* Operational semantics of programs, operationally-based program equivalences such as
  contextual equivalences and bisimulations.   
* Cost-models for reasoning about the optimizing power of transformations and the costs
  of evaluation.
* Program transformations for verification and theorem proving purposes. 
* Translation, simulation, equivalence of programs with different formalisms, and 
  evaluation strategies.
* Program transformations for applying rewriting techniques to programs in specific
  programming languages.
* Program transformations for program inversions and program synthesis. 
* Program transformation and evaluation for Haskell and Rewriting.

The programming languages of interest include pure, deterministic, impure, 
nondeterministic, concurrent, parallel languages, and may employ programming paradigms
such as functional, logical, typed, imperative, object-oriented, and higher-order.

Invited Speaker

Paper Submissions
=================
For the paper submission deadline an extended abstract of at most 10 pages is required
to be submitted. 
The extended abstract may present original work or also work in progress. 
However, for the formal post-proceedings (see below) full papers must be submitted to
the post-proceedings deadline.
Based on the submissions the program committee will select the presentations for the
workshop. All selected contributions will be included in the informal proceedings
distributed to the workshop participants. One author of each accepted extended abstract
is expected to present it at the workshop. Submissions must be prepared in LaTeX using
the EPTCS macro package (http://style.eptcs.org/).

Formal Post-Proceedings
=======================
The WPTE post-proceedings will be published in 
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (http://eptcs.org/).
The authors of all presented contributions will have the opportunity (but no obligation) 
to submit a full paper for the formal post-proceedings. 
These full-papers must represent original work and should not be submitted to another
conference at the same time. Full-papers should not exceed 15 pages. The submission 
deadline for these post-proceedings will be after the workshop in October 2017. 
There will be a second round of reviewing for selecting papers to be published
in the formal proceedings.

Important Dates
===============

 *  Submission deadline (extended abstracts):  July 21th, 2017  (Extended!)
 *  Notification of acceptance:                August 4th, 2017
 *  Deadline for participant proceedings:      August 11th, 2017
 *  Workshop:                                  September 8th, 2017
 
 *  Submission deadline for post proceedings (full-papers): 
                    October, 2017 (exact date to be announced)
