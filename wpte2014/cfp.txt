                               FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

                      First International Workshop on

   Rewriting Techniques for Program Transformations and Evaluation (WPTE'14)   

                        affiliated with RTA/TLCA 2014
      (a FLoC 2014 workshop, FLoC is part of the Vienna Summer of Logic 2014)
                       13th July 2014, Vienna, Austria

Aims and Scope
==============
The aim of WPTE is to bring together the researchers working on 
program transformations, evaluation, and operationally based programming
language semantics, using rewriting methods, in order to share the
techniques and recent developments and to exchange ideas to encourage
further activation of research in this area.

Topics of interest and in the scope of WPTE are:

* Correctness of program transformations, optimizations and translations.
* Program transformations for proving termination, confluence and other 
  properties.
* Correctness of evaluation strategies.
* Operational semantics of programs, operationally-based program equivalences
  such as contextual equivalences and bisimulations.
* Cost-models for arguing about the optimizing power of transformations and the
  costs of evaluation.
* Program transformations for verification and theorem proving purposes.
* Translation, simulation, equivalence of programs with different formalisms,
  and evaluation strategies.
* Program transformations for applying rewriting techniques to programs in 
  specific programming languages.
* Program inversions and program synthesis.

The programming languages of interest include pure, deterministic, impure,
non-deterministic, concurrent, parallel  languages, and may employ programming
paradigms such as functional, logical, typed,  imperative, object-oriented, 
and higher-order.

Paper Submissions and Proceedings
=================================
WPTE accepts two different kinds of contributions:

* Full-papers: 
  ------------
   Full-papers must represent original work and should be submitted using the 
   EasyChair interface.  We plan to publish full-papers as formal proceedings
   in the 'OpenAccess Series in Informatics (OASIcs)' of 
   'Schloss Dagstuhl Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik'.
   Full-papers should not exceed   12 pages   using the OASIcs LaTeX-templates.

* Work in progress:
  -----------------
   There will also be a slot for presenting work in progress.
   An extended abstract of at most   4 pages   is required to be submitted using 
   the EasyChair interface.  These contributions will not be included in the 
   OASIcs proceedings but they will be distributed to the workshop partipicants.

One author of each accepted paper or abstract is expected to present 
it at the workshop.

Important Dates
===============
* Submission deadline: 30 April 2014 (new!)
* Notification of acceptance: 23 May 2014
* Deadline for camera-ready proceedings: 28 May 2014
* Workshop:  13 July 2014, Austria, Vienna
